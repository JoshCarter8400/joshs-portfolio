            <p>
              Full Stack Web Developer and Personal Trainer with a background in
              sales and customer service. I am skilled on both the front-end and
              back-end of development but I definitely enjoy the back-end
              technologies much more. I have strong problem-solving skills and
              communicate well within a team as I am open-minded to all ideas
              and solutions. Iâ€™m constantly seeking ways to improve myself and
              thinking of how to be helpful to those around me. You will get a
              person with an eagerness to learn and willingness to try new
              things. I will always give you an honest effort to put forth the
              best quality product possible.
